Poke the Dots is a mini game created with the Python programming language. 

A window opens with two dots(filled circles) in it moving around. The player must not let them collide. 
The dots can change position by pressing the mouse button in the screen. It doesn't matter where, any window position will do. There is also a score board that counts how much the player can manage to make the dots not collide. 
After a while more dots will appear and also the velocity of the dots increases. The player doesn't have to stop all the dots from colliding. The extra dots are there for confusing the player.
After loosing the player can choose to replay or he/she can exit the game by closing the window. The window can close at any time. 

The game was created while attending the course "Problem Solving, Python Programming, and Video Games" by University of Alberta, in Coursera. 
This course is an introduction to computer science and programming with Python.
